# WebAssembly FDW Comparison Findings

## Key Differences Between Implementations

After comparing the Rust and AssemblyScript WebAssembly implementations, we've identified several critical differences:

### 1. WebAssembly Format

The most significant difference is in the WebAssembly module format:

- **Rust Implementation**: Uses the WebAssembly Component Model (version `0d 00 01 00`)
- **AssemblyScript Implementation**: Uses standard WebAssembly (version `01 00 00 00`)

This format difference is likely the primary reason why the Rust implementation works with Supabase but the AssemblyScript one doesn't. Supabase's WebAssembly FDW system is expecting the Component Model format.

### 2. Exported Functions

Both implementations export similar functions required by the FDW interface:
- `host_version_requirement`
- `init`
- `begin_scan`
- `iter_scan`
- `re_scan`
- `end_scan`
- `begin_modify`
- `insert`
- `update`
- `delete_` (AssemblyScript) / `delete` (Rust)
- `end_modify`

### 3. Memory Management

- **AssemblyScript Implementation**: Exports memory and utility functions for memory management
- **Rust Implementation**: Uses the Component Model's memory management

## Recommendations

To make the AssemblyScript implementation compatible with Supabase:

1. **Use the WebAssembly Component Model**:
   - Investigate tools like [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) to convert standard WebAssembly to the Component Model format
   - Consider using [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) for AssemblyScript

2. **Match the Rust Implementation's Interface**:
   - Ensure function signatures match exactly
   - Use the same memory model and string handling approach

3. **Consider a Hybrid Approach**:
   - Use AssemblyScript for development and testing
   - Use the Rust implementation for production with Supabase

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate WebAssembly Component Model Tools**:
   - Research tools that can convert AssemblyScript's output to the Component Model format
   - Explore if there are AssemblyScript bindings for the Component Model

2. **Test with Supabase Simulator**:
   - Use the Supabase simulator to test both implementations
   - Identify specific compatibility issues

3. **Consider Switching to Rust**:
   - If compatibility issues persist, consider switching to Rust for production use
   - Use AssemblyScript for prototyping and development
