# WebAssembly Component Model Findings

## Key Differences Between Implementations

After comparing the AssemblyScript and Rust WebAssembly implementations, we've identified the critical difference:

### WebAssembly Format

- **Rust Implementation**: Uses the WebAssembly Component Model format (version `0d 00 01 00`)
- **AssemblyScript Implementation**: Uses standard WebAssembly format (version `01 00 00 00`)

This format difference is the primary reason why the Rust implementation works with Supabase but the AssemblyScript one doesn't. Supabase's WebAssembly FDW system is specifically designed to work with the Component Model format.

### File Size Comparison

- **Rust WebAssembly File**: 124,832 bytes
- **AssemblyScript WebAssembly File**: 6,381 bytes

The significant size difference suggests that the Rust implementation includes additional functionality or metadata required by the Component Model.

## What is the WebAssembly Component Model?

The WebAssembly Component Model is a new standard that extends WebAssembly to better support language interoperability and modular composition. It provides:

1. **Interface Types**: A way to define interfaces between WebAssembly modules and host environments
2. **Component Linking**: A mechanism for linking multiple WebAssembly modules together
3. **Resource Management**: Better handling of resources like memory and tables

## Recommendations

To make the AssemblyScript implementation compatible with Supabase:

1. **Use Specialized Tools**:
   - [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) for converting standard WebAssembly to the Component Model format
   - [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) for generating bindings from WIT definitions

2. **Consider Using Rust for Production**:
   - Since the Rust implementation already works with Supabase, it might be more practical to use it for production
   - AssemblyScript can still be used for development and testing

3. **Explore Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Use AssemblyScript for rapid development and prototyping
   - Convert to Rust for the production build

## Next Steps

1. **Install Specialized Tools**:
   ```bash
   cargo install wasm-tools
   ```

2. **Convert AssemblyScript WebAssembly to Component Model**:
   ```bash
   wasm-tools component new build/component-model.wasm -o build-component/postgres_wasm_fdw_as.wasm --adapt wasi_snapshot_preview1=wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
   ```

3. **Test with Supabase**:
   - Deploy the converted WebAssembly file to Supabase
   - Test if it works with the Supabase FDW system
